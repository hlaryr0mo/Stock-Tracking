# Stock Tracking ðŸ“ˆ

Calling all stock champions and market messiahs! I channeled my inner coding ninja and built this stock tracking app in React Native... for a job interview (turns out their loss, right? wink wink).  It only took me 2 epic days (okay, maybe more Netflix than coding involved) but hey, I'm proud as punch to unleash it on the world!

Ready to ditch the stonky spreadsheets and level up your investing game? This app might be simpler than a participation trophy (seriously, it's delightful), but it gets the job done. Just fire it up with EXPO and you'll be a market mover and shaker in no time.

P.S. Don't let anyone rain on your parade. Even if you don't land the dream job (those recruiters can be clueless!), you can still build something awesome. Now go forth and conquer the market!

P.P.S. Speaking of conquering... **any awesome companies out there looking for a talented developer with a knack for building ridiculously useful (and slightly ridiculous) apps?   Just sayin'.**
